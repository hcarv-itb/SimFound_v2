Protein Design 2021
===================

Protein Design course, Henrique F. Carvalho 2021.

This is a rough backbone tutorial of the topics that will be adressed during the course. 


The core of the course is the **Project**.
The project will be executed in a laboratory, just like in real Biology. 
This time, the laboratory will be **Jupyter**, a program that allows users to create and share code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. 

To be able to work with JupyterLab, you need to have installed in your working computer **Anaconda**. 
Anaconda allows one to install software packages and handles the dependencies, which is a valuable help when working on different computers.

The programming languange used during the course will be `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.

At the end of the course, your project will be a notebook containing a description of the tasks in **Markdown** and python code in **Code** cells, with no bugs, fully operational under your local anaconda environment.
